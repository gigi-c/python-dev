# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangable and allows duplicate members
# Since tuple is unchangeable, therefore list is more widely use because it is more flexable
essentials = ("bread", "eggs", "milk")
print(essentials)
print(essentials.count("bread"))
essentials[0] = "beans"  #cannot do this because tuple is UNCHANGEABLE
